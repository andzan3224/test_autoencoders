- generation of test set
- encode_decode on test set after training
- add noise to MNIST part and see the effect on reconstruction, evaluating effect of depth
- add error generator  to TypAutoenco
- multiSoftmax as output layer instead of simgoid output layer in the decoder, for TypoAutoenco
 (this can be done directly as Logit are already calculated with "tf.add(tf.matmul"). Need however to divide the all bunch of logits so calculated into
 groups of 36. Every group into one softmax and then cross-entropy with 1-hot from Ground Trught (the inputs!)
